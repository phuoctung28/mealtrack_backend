# Meal Planning Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the Smart Meal Planner Assistant feature as described in the `meal_plan.md` specification. The implementation includes a conversational AI assistant that helps users create customized meal plans based on their dietary preferences, fitness goals, and lifestyle constraints.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Domain Models (`domain/model/`)
- **MealPlan**: Main meal plan entity with user preferences and days
- **PlannedMeal**: Individual meal with nutrition info and instructions
- **UserPreferences**: User's dietary preferences, goals, and constraints
- **Conversation**: Conversation session management
- **ConversationContext**: Stores user inputs during conversation

### 2. Services (`domain/services/`)
- **MealPlanService**: Generates meal plans using Google Gemini AI
- **ConversationService**: Manages conversational flow and state transitions

### 3. API Endpoints (`api/routes/v1/meal_plans.py`)
- `POST /v1/meal-plans/conversations/start` - Start new conversation
- `POST /v1/meal-plans/conversations/{id}/messages` - Send message to assistant
- `GET /v1/meal-plans/conversations/{id}` - Get conversation history
- `POST /v1/meal-plans/generate` - Generate meal plan directly
- `GET /v1/meal-plans/{id}` - Get existing meal plan
- `POST /v1/meal-plans/{id}/meals/replace` - Replace specific meal

### 4. Database Models (`infra/database/models/meal_plan.py`)
- Tables for persisting meal plans, conversations, and messages
- Migration file for creating new tables

### 5. Tests (`tests/test_meal_planning.py`)
- Conversation flow tests
- Direct meal plan generation tests
- API endpoint tests

## Key Features

### Conversational Interface
- Natural language conversation flow
- Guided questions for gathering preferences
- Context-aware responses
- Confirmation before generating plan

### Meal Plan Generation
- AI-powered meal suggestions using Google Gemini
- Respects all dietary restrictions and allergies
- Adapts to fitness goals (muscle gain, weight loss, etc.)
- Considers available cooking time
- Includes favorite cuisines and avoids disliked ingredients

### Flexible API
- Both conversational and direct generation options
- RESTful endpoints for all operations
- Comprehensive error handling

## Usage Example

### Starting a Conversation
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/meal-plans/conversations/start?user_id=user123"
```

### Sending Messages
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/meal-plans/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I am gluten-free and vegetarian"}'
```

### Direct Generation
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/meal-plans/generate?user_id=user123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "preferences": {
      "dietary_preferences": ["vegetarian", "gluten_free"],
      "allergies": ["nuts"],
      "fitness_goal": "muscle_gain",
      "meals_per_day": 3,
      "snacks_per_day": 2,
      "cooking_time_weekday": 30,
      "cooking_time_weekend": 60,
      "favorite_cuisines": ["Italian"],
      "disliked_ingredients": ["tofu"],
      "plan_duration": "weekly"
    }
  }'
```

## Next Steps

To fully deploy this feature:

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file

3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py api
   # or specifically
   pytest tests/test_meal_planning.py
   ```

## Technical Notes

- The conversation state machine ensures smooth flow
- In-memory storage for conversations (production should use database)
- Fallback meals provided if AI generation fails
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
- Full type safety with Pydantic schemas

## Architecture Benefits

- Clean separation of concerns (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
- Easy to extend with new dietary preferences or meal types
- Testable components with clear interfaces
- Scalable design that can handle multiple concurrent conversations

The implementation successfully meets all requirements from the original specification while maintaining the existing codebase architecture and standards.
