## Failure policy matrix

| Dependency | Class | On failure |
|------------|-------|------------|
| PostgreSQL | **Required** | Fail fast (typically 503) |
| Firebase Auth | **Required** | Fail fast (401) |
| AI provider stack | **Required for AI routes** | Circuit breaker → next model in chain; exhausted chain raises `AIUnavailableError` |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | **Optional routed provider** | Skip / fall through; disable via env |
| Cloudinary | **Best-effort media** | Degrade (fallback URL construction where coded) |
| RevenueCat | **Billing sync** | Webhook/cache degrade; last-known subscription where available. Premium route gates are not enforced yet |
| Redis optional caches | **Optional** | Bypass cache; continue from source of truth |
| Redis provider budget | **Required for provider-origin manual writes** | Fail closed with `NUTRITION_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Redis meal-suggestion sessions | **Required transient state** (current design) | Session writes fail when store unavailable |
| OpenAI translation | **Optional read-path localization** | Return canonical local/provider results without translated names; do not block startup or writes |
| OpenAI, FatSecret, USDA, OFF, Brave, image stock APIs | **Optional enrichment** | Degrade to local/prior results when safe |
| PostHog | **Optional analytics** | Skip capture |
| Sentry | **Optional observability** | Local logs only; facade no-ops without DSN |
| nutree-affiliate | **Optional partner** | Validate may return inactive; lifecycle events retry via outbox |

**Redis rule:** optional caches are never the source of truth for nutrition,
notification delivery, FCM token ownership, or write-path correctness. Cache
admission policy: `docs/decisions/260608-2223-selective-cache-admission-policy.md`.
Provider-origin v2 manual saves use Redis and `NUTRITION_PROVIDER_GLOBAL_RPM`
(default **60** if unset or empty). `ENVIRONMENT=development` may use a
process-local budget if Redis is down so local catalog-food saves work.
`CACHE_ENABLED=false` may disable optional cache reads, but it must not
disable this shared write-path budget.

**Privacy rule:** never log prompts, food payloads, raw AI output, base64
images, emails, auth tokens, full barcodes, or secrets. Prefer operation name,
internal IDs, status codes, and error class.

## Non-derivable integration rules

### AI provider routing

- Runtime registry is **OpenAI + optional Cloudflare Workers AI**. Gemini
  packages may remain in dependencies but are not registered as a runtime
  provider unless code changes that fact.
- `AIModelManager` owns per-purpose fallback chains and the circuit breaker
  (failures open the breaker; recovery is coded in the manager).
- Text and vision Cloudflare paths are independent (LangChain text vs REST
  vision). Vision model IDs and purpose lists are settings-owned — read
  `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_AI_*` from settings, not this doc.
- Optional graph workflow (`AI_MEAL_ANALYZE_GRAPH_ENABLED`) must not change
  provider order or READY meal API contracts.
- Optional FatSecret meal validation is never required for a valid scan.
- Prompt cache (OpenAI Responses via LangChain) is best-effort; keys hash
  system prompt only — never raw user text/images. Monitor facade metrics before
  claiming savings.
- Never log `[AI-*]` payloads beyond provider, model alias, purpose, status,
  error class.

### Translation ownership and privacy

- Read-path localization is owned by `src/app/services/food_name_localizer.py`
  and the translation services under `src/domain/services/translation/` and
  `src/domain/services/meal_*_translation_service.py`.
- The OpenAI translation adapter uses the Responses API with
  `store_responses=False`; the translation path never opts back into payload
  storage.
- Persisted meal translation rows written before the active translation version
  are treated as stale and excluded from responses until the next translation
  request rewrites them.
- Translation requests are bounded indexed batches. The adapter sends the
  indexed item text only, treats it as data rather than instructions, and
  preserves placeholders, units, and brands.
- `TranslationOutcome.TRANSLATED` is the only cache/persistence-eligible
  outcome. `PARTIAL`, `PASSTHROUGH`, and `UNAVAILABLE` fall back to canonical
  text and stay out of locale caches and persisted translation rows.

### Barcode cascade reliability

Order and verification rules (handlers/adapters own exact implementation):

1. Local `food_reference` / cache with GTIN aliases  
2. FatSecret exact barcode  
3. OpenFoodFacts exact barcode  
4. USDA FDC branded exact `gtinUpc` (when key present)  
5. Brave + AI as estimate hints only  
6. AI estimate last  

Invalid GTIN → 400 before external calls. Exact provider hits may be cached as
verified data. Brave-only / name-only / AI estimates return `is_estimate=true`
and must not enter the global catalog. Logs must not include full raw barcodes.

### Redis cache posture

| Data | Policy |
|------|--------|
| Food search/details, nutrition lookup, AI cost caches | Optional cache-aside; miss/error → source of truth |
| Auth UID mapping | Process-local TTL, not Redis |
| Notification rows / FCM ownership | Database only — do not cache as source of truth |
| Meal suggestion sessions | Required Redis-backed transient state today |

Default: do not cache. Admission checklist lives in the selective-cache decision
above. `FAIL_ON_CACHE_ERROR=false` is the expected production posture for
optional caches.

### Parse-text nutrition validation

- `/v1/meals/parse-text` keeps its authenticated and guest response contracts;
  structured local `food_reference` and staged FatSecret details are optional
  enrichment behind `PARSE_TEXT_STRUCTURED_REFERENCE_ENABLED` (default `false`).
- The handler derives calories from final macros. Provider detail calls are
  bounded to one selected candidate per item, with a request-wide deadline and
  call budget; invalid or ambiguous provider data falls back only when the AI
  estimate passes density checks.
- Run `python scripts/development/evaluate_parse_text_nutrition.py --mode offline`
  for the hermetic golden corpus. Live evaluation is staging-only, opt-in via
  `ENVIRONMENT=staging` and `PARSE_TEXT_LIVE_EVAL_ENABLED=true`, and requires
  explicit `--confirm-live-staging`; reports are synthetic-ID, aggregate-only,
  non-overwriting, and written with private `0600` permissions.

### RevenueCat and web redemption

- Webhooks update local `subscriptions`; signature verification is constant-time.
- Web checkout handoff is `/v1/web-funnel/*` (hash-only redemption link, Firebase
  passwordless, preflight/finalize). Contracts: `api-endpoints.md`.
- Billing ownership is RevenueCat Web; legacy direct Paddle fulfillment is gone.
- Premium feature gates are planned, not enforced on routes.

### Sentry ownership

- Runtime code uses the `src.observability` facade only. Direct `sentry_sdk`
  imports belong in `src/infra/monitoring/sentry.py`.
- One root-cause ERROR per unexpected request failure (API exception handlers).
  Do not log-and-rethrow (duplicate Sentry issues). Background/cron boundaries
  own their own capture when they swallow exceptions.
- Expected 4xx domain failures are silent at ERROR level.
- Severity contract: INFO = normal; WARNING = degrade/retry/slow; ERROR =
  user-impacting; CRITICAL = service unusable. Same privacy allowlist as above.
- Use Sentry metrics for operational AI failure alerts; use PostHog for product
  / LLM product traces — not P1 outage paging.

### nutree-affiliate boundary

MealTrack and nutree-affiliate are **separate services and databases**. Never
join or write affiliate tables from MealTrack.

- Sync path: HMAC-signed HTTP via `affiliate_service_adapter` +
  `affiliate_event_outbox` + cron dispatcher.
- Identity: `mealtrack_user_id` here; `affiliate_id` only in affiliate service.
- Architecture ownership table: `system-architecture.md` → Affiliate System
  Boundary.
- Signing contract and outbox retry live in the adapter, model, and
  `tests/unit/infra/adapters/test_affiliate_service_adapter_signing.py`.

### Health surfaces

Discover paths in OpenAPI. Typical ops probes: `/health`, `/v1/health/db-pool`,
`/v1/health/db-connections`, `/v1/health/notifications`.
