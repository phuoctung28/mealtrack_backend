## Completed Phases

### June 2026: Python 3.13 and Dependency Standardization
- [x] Upgraded runtime, Docker, CI, and documented backend baseline to Python 3.13.
- [x] Upgraded FastAPI and core production libraries to current Python 3.13-compatible releases.
- [x] Pinned direct production and test dependencies for reproducible local, CI, and Docker installs.
- [x] Removed unused `fatsecret` package dependency; runtime FatSecret integration uses the in-repo HTTP adapter.
- [x] Upgraded pytest tooling to 9.x to clear the test dependency audit finding.
- [x] Verified `requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` with `pip-audit`; ML-only `torch` remains isolated in `requirements-ml.txt` pending an upstream CVE fix.

### June 2026: Single-Owner Logger System
- [x] Established log-or-raise rule: one root-cause `ERROR` per unexpected request failure; expected 4xx exceptions produce zero ERROR logs.
- [x] `src/api/exception_handlers.py` — new central exception boundary with `register_exception_handlers(app)`; owns single ERROR for unexpected exceptions.
- [x] `RequestLoggerMiddleware` — 5xx response lines downgraded from ERROR to WARNING (outcome indicator only).
- [x] `handle_exception()` in `src/api/exceptions.py` — pure conversion helper, no ERROR log before re-raise.
- [x] All command/query handlers — removed `logger.error` before re-raise patterns.
- [x] `src/infra/services/ai/ai_model_manager.py` — emits `log_event("warning", "ai.provider.failure")` before raising `AIUnavailableError`.
- [x] Cron entrypoints — emit `log_event("info", "cron.phase.completed")` per phase; `capture_exception` + `flush_observability` on failure.
- [x] `src/infra/services/affiliate_outbox_dispatch_service.py` — emits `increment_metric("affiliate.outbox.failure")` for permanent failures.
- [x] Architecture guardrails: `tests/unit/architecture/test_logging_ownership_guardrails.py` and `tests/unit/api/test_single_owner_exception_logging.py`.

### June 2026: Observability Connector
- [x] Added provider-neutral observability facade with no-op fallback and Sentry connector.
- [x] Isolated all direct `sentry_sdk` usage to `src/infra/monitoring/sentry.py`.
- [x] Migrated API startup, request context, cron flush/capture, and affiliate outbox permanent failure alerts through the facade.
- [x] Enabled configurable Sentry Logs, operational metrics, and explicit profile session settings through the connector.
- [x] Added safe scalar attribute filtering for logs and metrics.
- [x] Documented Sentry event contract, safe context allowlist, and alert/dashboard setup guidance.
- [x] Normalized production log severity semantics and removed raw AI response,
      image URL, email, and webhook provider identifiers from representative
      application logs.

### June 2026: Vision Parser Resilience
- [x] Canonical AI nutrition contracts now reject impossible over-limit food quantities before domain hydration, invalid AI items now fail instead of being silently repaired, and structured meal image/text output retries exactly once before raising controlled `AIOutputValidationError`.
- [x] Meal image analysis now carries an explicit `is_food` guard through Gemini schema validation, adapter mapping, parsers, command handlers, and API error mapping so explicit non-food images reject before nutrition parsing without changing successful meal response shape.
- [x] LLM nutrition output contracts: Structured Pydantic contracts for all AI meal-analysis flows; bounded validation retry; parser becomes deterministic mapping; `quantity=150000` and similar impossible AI outputs are rejected before persistence. Background event handler sanitizes `AIOutputValidationError` into a user-friendly failure message. `PromptEvalLoop` tracks schema `validation_success_rate` as a separate observable metric alongside `parse_success_rate`.

### June 2026: Normalized Database Foundation
- [x] Added normalized profile preferences, hydration entries, saved suggestion items/steps, meal instruction steps, food serving sizes, and food nutrient tables.
- [x] Added typed payout workflow fields while retaining raw payout details pending a later security/contract pass.
- [x] Documented notification context as render snapshot only; recipient truth remains in `user_fcm_tokens`.
- [x] Production migration runner is Alembic-only and no longer creates/stamps schema from `Base.metadata`.
- [x] Local Postgres upgrade verified to Alembic head `20260609000006`.

### June 2026: Neon Direct Pool + Async Library Alignment
- [x] Explicit DB connection mode resolver: `direct_pool` uses a dedicated async queue pool against the direct Neon URL; `neon_pooler` uses `NullPool` with PgBouncer-safe asyncpg settings.
- [x] `APP_DATABASE_URL` is the app runtime URL; `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` is migration/admin only — no silent priority drift.
- [x] `FoodDataService` converted from `requests` to `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- [x] Cloudinary blocking SDK calls wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread` off-loop boundary.
- [x] Static guard blocks uncontained `requests` imports under `src/infra/adapters`.
- [x] Health endpoint (`/v1/health/db-pool`) reports connection mode, pool type, and capacity.
- [x] `.env.example`, `docs/database-guide.md`, and `docs/external-services.md` updated to match runtime contract.
- [x] Completed 2026-06-10.

### June 2026: Async Repository Consolidation
- [x] Runtime database access consolidated to async SQLAlchemy: FastAPI dependencies, cron jobs, handlers, repositories, and UoW use `AsyncSession`.
- [x] Deleted the sync unit-of-work runtime, sync database config, and legacy sync repositories after replacing remaining test consumers with explicit test-only facades.
- [x] Architecture guard now expects zero sync DB runtime imports in `src` and no broad sync repository transition allowlist.
- [x] Default validation: `pytest -q` passes (`1499 passed, 3 skipped`).

### June 2026: Weekly Budget Resilience
- [x] Weekly budget meal loading now quarantines malformed legacy `READY` rows without nutrition before domain hydration.

### June 2026: iOS Notification Payload Hardening
- [x] Removed obsolete direct notification service wiring and direct meal/summary helper sends.
- [x] Removed background push scheduler lifecycle, scheduler leader lock, stale test notification route, and misleading legacy push/email service names; cron entrypoints now own notification/email work.
- [x] `FirebaseService` rejects blank display text before sending APNs payloads and mobile `data` fields.
- [x] iOS/APNs payload tests cover non-empty alert title/body for valid sends and fail-closed behavior for blank-input sends.

### May 2026 (late): Notification Overhaul, RevenueCat Webhook Expansion, Meal-Suggestion Parallel Generator
- [x] Platform-specific FCM payload builders: `android_payload_builder.py` (high-priority, channel IDs), `apns_payload_builder.py` (APNs Time Sensitive, `interruption-level` in payload body)
- [x] Trial-expiry push notifications at T-2d and T-1d via `CronTrialPushService`
- [x] Timezone-change notification reschedule in `UpdateTimezoneCommandHandler` and `RegisterFcmTokenCommandHandler`
- [x] `DailyContextPrecomputeService`: batch pre-computes user calorie context for timezone-local dates
- [x] `src/cron/push.py`: Render cron pipeline for precompute, trial-expiry scheduling, due-row FCM dispatch, and expired-row cleanup
- [x] RevenueCat webhook full lifecycle: INITIAL_PURCHASE, RENEWAL, CANCELLATION, EXPIRATION, BILLING_ISSUE, PRODUCT_CHANGE, REFUND, TRANSFER
- [x] PostHog lifecycle mirroring for subscription events via `PostHogAdapter`
- [x] Referral credit/revoke wired to INITIAL_PURCHASE / REFUND webhooks
- [x] Parallel recipe generator: 3-phase pipeline (name generation → parallel generation → translation)
- [x] `src/cron/email.py`: Render cron pipeline for re-engagement and trial-expiry lifecycle emails

### May 2026 (early): Nutrition Fixes, Referral Improvements, Email Deep Links
- [x] Configurable referral commission rates via `REFERRAL_COMMISSIONS` env var (per-currency JSON)
- [x] Custom unit-to-grams normalization fix in nutrition calculation (`convert_quantity_to_grams`)
- [x] BMR floor raised to 85% of standard daily; cutting deficit reduced 500→300 kcal (clinical floor: 1200F/1500M)
- [x] Email Universal Links: `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` + `/app-download` redirect
- [x] AsyncUnitOfWork concurrency guard (`asyncio.Lock`); handlers cloned with fresh UoW per dispatch
- [x] Variable-length referral codes: 3–15 characters

## Current Priorities (Q2 2026)
1. **Performance**: Optimize suggestion generation (target <10s from ~45s) — in progress.
2. **Security**: Restrict CORS in production (`allow_origins=["*"]` currently wide open), add PII redaction to request logging — open.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Tune rate limits on `meal_suggestions` endpoints (discover, generate) — open.
4. **Testing**: Increase coverage for meal discovery and notification dedup logic — open.
5. **Premium Gating**: Apply `require_premium` dependency to premium-only routes — open.

- [ ] Refactor hardcoded values (MAX_FILE_SIZE, SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD) to config

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add monitoring for Gemini API quota and Cloudinary storage limits
- [ ] Consider using DI for CloudinaryImageStore instead of direct instantiation in routes
- [ ] Tune rate limiting thresholds for meal_suggestions endpoints based on usage patterns

### Low Priority
- [ ] Review dev meal seeding to prevent DB clutter in long-running environments
- [ ] Document meal discovery image search quality thresholds
