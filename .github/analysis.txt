The main failures in your job are caused by database errors, specifically:

1. Table 'mealimage' already exists
2. Assertion failures in your tests due to failed database operations
3. RuntimeError: no running event loop and various PyMySQL connection errors

Here's how to resolve these issues:

---

### 1. Table 'mealimage' already exists

Your tests are trying to create the mealimage table when it already exists, causing OperationalError (1050). This is a classic test isolation/setup problem.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your test database is clean before each test run.
- Drop the mealimage table (and any other relevant tables) before recreating them.
- Alternatively, use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in your migrations or test setup.
- If using SQLAlchemy, use `Base.metadata.drop_all()` followed by `Base.metadata.create_all()` at the start of your tests.

**Example fix in your test setup:**
```python
# Wherever you initialize your test DB (e.g., in conftest.py or setup/teardown)
from src.models import Base  # adjust import as needed
engine = ...  # your SQLAlchemy engine
Base.metadata.drop_all(engine)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### 2. PyMySQL/SQLAlchemy Interface and Connection Errors

You are seeing errors such as:
- `pymysql.err.InterfaceError: (0, '')`
- `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'settimeout'`
- `[Errno 9] Bad file descriptor`

These indicate that database connections are being closed or mismanaged, likely due to:
- Connections not being properly closed between tests
- Async event loop issues in your test environment

**Solution:**
- Ensure each test properly tears down/rolls back database connections.
- Use context managers or fixtures to manage DB connections.
- If using async tests, ensure the event loop is properly managed (pytest-asyncio or similar).

**Example for pytest:**
```python
import pytest
import asyncio

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def event_loop():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()
    yield loop
    loop.close()
```

### 3. Test Assertion Failures

Test `test_concurrent_meal_uploads` expects at least 3 uploads to succeed, but only 1 does, indicating that the above DB/state issues are interfering with actual test logic.

**Solution:**
- Fix the DB setup issues first. Most likely, once your database is reliably reset between tests, this test will pass.
- If not, add debug logs to see why uploads are failing.

---

## Summary of Action Items

1. Clean up your test database before each test run.
2. Use `drop_all` and `create_all` for SQLAlchemy models in your test setup.
3. Manage DB connections and event loops properly in your tests.
4. Re-run your workflow after these changes.
